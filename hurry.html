<p>Hurry Maguire has disclose that he will not be forced out of his house following a bomb threat targeting his house</p>

<p>Police Offices came with sniffer dogs to his house after he received a bomb threat via email which came after they lost 4-0 to Liverpool in the premier league. The player lives with his partner and two daughters.</p>

<p>"The safety of his family and those around him is obviously Harry's number one priority. He will continue to prepare for this weekend's fixture as normal and we will not be commenting in any further detail at this point."His spokesperson words</p>
