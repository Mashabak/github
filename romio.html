<p>Cape Town – South African actors and celebrity couple Stephanie and Hungani Ndlovu have opened up about their miscarriage.  </p>


  <p>
The couple revealed on their YouTube channel The Ndlovus Uncut that they were expecting their first child in July 2020 but miscarried at eight weeks.  </p>


<p>The pair described their experience as the worst they had ever had.  </p>


  <p>
Stephanie said in the video that she brought a camera to her gynecologist appointment to film everything for Hungani because he couldn’t join her due to Covid-19 protocols.  </p>



  <p>
“This is all during Covid-19 and Hungani couldn’t go in … I think our first check-up was at eight weeks, and I’m sitting there … I already had my video camera out because I wanted to record for him.  </p>


  <p>
“I take my video out and it wasn’t even a minute and she (gynecologist) literally did the scan … and said ‘sorry, there is no embryo’. She said I should take a moment, I did not. I jumped off the bed, I did not cry, I literally just said okay,” said Stephanie.</p>
