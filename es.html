South Africa: Eskom could repeat worst power cuts in its history
The state power company is struggling to meet power demand due to labour protests over wage talks disrupting operations.

<p>
South African state power utility Eskom may be forced to implement power cuts lasting at least six hours a day, after 10 generation units went offline overnight and a strike disrupted its operations.

<p>
The cuts could begin on Tuesday, company executives said at an emergency briefing.

<p>
The so-called “Stage 6” electricity cuts Eskom is currently facing have only been implemented once before in its history, it said. The group’s ageing coal-fired power station fleet is highly prone to faults, and its ability to return units to service has been constrained by labour protests.</p>

<p>
The protests began last week after wage talks between Eskom and trade unions including the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa and the National Union of Mineworkers reached a deadlock.</p>

<p>
Eskom has been implementing Stage 4 power cuts requiring up to 4,000 megawatts (MW) to be shed from the national grid since late last week. Stage 6 outages would require up to 6,000 MW to be shed, and were only implemented once before, in December 2019.</p>

<p>
Eskom’s Chief Operating Officer Jan Oberholzer said for most South Africans Stage 6 outages meant at least six hours of power cuts during the day.</p>


<p>
“We are not yet at Stage 6, but the risk is very high,” he told a news conference on Tuesday. “We will try whatever we can to avoid it.”</p>

<p>
The rand, which had been trading stronger against the dollar in early trade, weakened on the warning from Eskom.</p>

<p>
The utility plans to meet union leaders later on Tuesday to try to resolve issues relating to the strike, Eskom Chief Executive Andre de Ruyter said.</p>

<p>
Eskom was granted a court interdict to block the strike, but the protests have continued.</p>

<p>
The loss-making utility, saddled with debt approaching 400 billion rand ($25.2bn), is trying to contain costs as part of a turnaround plan.</p>

<p>
Reforming Eskom is a priority for President Cyril Ramaphosa’s government, but efforts to improve its performance have barely achieved results.</p>
